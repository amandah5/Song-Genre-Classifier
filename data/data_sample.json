I've got just one question:\nHow could you do something like this? I'm so hurt!\"\nHe looked at her and said, \"Bitch please, you've got your nerve\nWith all your club hopping, lying saying you was shopping\nAnd now here you are in our home, and you're calling me wrong?\"\nShe said, \"Okay, you busted me!\nAnd that much I agree, you've caught me cheating!\nBut this is a little extreme!\"\nHe said, \"You are my wife sleeping behind my back\nAnd now I come home and you got him in the closet, how extreme is that?!\"\nAnd she said, \"But she's a he!\"\nThen he said, \"Please, you can't judge me\"\nShe said, \"Rufus, this is crazy!\"\nThen I said, \"Stop arguing!\nI did not stay here to hear y'all chew each other out\nSo, get to the point, or I swear I'm out!\"\n\"Excuse me, please, but I think I can explain what's going on in here\nMy name is Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year\nAt midnight creeping around with him has been a living hell\nSneaking in and out of hotels\"\nI said, \"Brother, spare me the details!\"\nThen Rufus said, \"Chuck, please! Don't say nothing else!\"\nThen she screams, \"Rufus, you son of a bitch\"\nHe says, \"Cathy, go to hell!\"\nI said, \"I thought you said your name was Mary\nThat what you said at the party\nMan this is gettin' scary, I'm gonna shoot somebody\"\nThen Rufus starts yelling and screaming, saying, \"Cathy, this is all your fault!\"\nShe throws a pillow at him and says, \"You were creeping too\nThe only difference is you didn't get caught!\"\nChuck screamed out, \"WE'RE IN LOVE!\"\nCathy says, \"Love my ass!\"\nRufus said they're getting married, then I shoot one in the air!\nThen I said, \"Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word!\n'Cause all this shit I'm going through is unheard!\"\nI grabbed my cellular\nSaid, \"This is so wrong\", I call up my home\nAnd a man picks up the phone (phone, phone, phone...)\n\"Hello?

We don't know!\nI guarantee a truly legendary show\n\nThis season's new recruits include the cast of Kinky Boots\nYou know, they're beautiful and buff as Navy SEALs\nAnd you could bounce a quarter off the ass of Billy Porter\nLord, he does eight shows a week in eight inch heels\nHats off to Berry Gordy, he runs Motown like a boss\nHe dominates Top 40 and he banged Diana Ross!\nHe wrote his own libretto, which is really kinda ballin'\nHe took every Motown classic and he said \"Ah, I'll put 'em all in.\"\n\nMake it bigger\nThat's right, it's bigger\nI just learned this dance like half an hour ago\nWe're going bigger\nLike, so much bigger\nYou ever seen so many divas in a row? (Hell, no!)\nWell stick with me, 'cause your emcee's a seasoned pro\nIt's Pippin! Never slippin', always flippin'\nAs he's pinin' for his corner of the sky\nBut the sky is over crowded with his oh-so-highly-touted cast of singing circus people flying by\nThe cast of Bring It On had count 'em thirty two debuts\nHey kids, welcome to Broadway, don't forget your union dues.\nIn tandem like we planned 'em\nForgive me if it's random\nBut Mike Tyson had a one-man show\nLet's give the man a hand and make things bigger\n\nThat's right it's bigger\nI'm here with Iron Mike\nHe's heavy weight, yo\nLet's make it bigger\nTonight it's bigger\nHey we've got cheerleaders, contortionists, and so\nGo find a sports bar, change the channel to our show\n(Go! Neil, go!)\n\nThe magical Matildas stole the show and nearly killed us\nSo they got a special Tony of their own,\nWhich strikes at the Achilles of the jaded former Billys\nThey get Tonys but get fired when they're grown\nNow here's the kids from Christmas Story, Annie and her orphans\nSo many child actors high on Red Bull and endorphins\nThey barely come up to your knees, but God, they're singing like MVPs\nAnd they're the reason this whole season seems to look like Chuck E. Cheese\nAnd jeez it's bigger\nThat's right it's bigger\nIs there a Tony daycare where all of you go?\nYou're getting bigger (When we're bigger)\nTonight it's bigger (We're bigger)\nSo do your parents set aside your Broadway dough? (Heck, no!)\nWhen I played Doogie...never mind, on with the show\n(Go, Neil, Go!)\nOh! Broadway's where famous people go\nThough being famous doesn't mean that you will get a good review\nSo Alec, write Ben Brantley if you want \"that's entertaining\" too\nWe've got magic to do!\n\nBigger\nThat's right it's bigger\nI'm walkin' down the aisle with some Newsies in tow\nYa know it's bigger\nYeah, so much bigger\nIf there's a Newsie you prefer, you let me know\nYou'll get a Newsie in your gift bag when you go!\n\n[spoken]\nIt's true. It's true, there's like 150 of those punks. Oh wait, oh wait, check this out. Can I have my Tom Hooper 'Les Miz' closeup please? See, on Broadway we don't need extreme closeups to prove we're singing live. We sing live eight shows a week. Check it!\n\n[sung]\nAt the end of the day we are gathered together to honor the best and the brightest\nAnd tomorrow the fashion police will report on your dress and who wore it the tightest\nIf you win, have the time of your life\nTell your manager, dad, and your mom, \"Thanks.\"\nSay hi to your kids and your husband or wife\nMaybe just for the hell of it, Tom Hanks!\nNothing is bigger and better than seeing a veteran get an ovation or seeing a brilliant beginner freak out on a win on their first nomination\nThere's a kid in the middle of nowhere who's sitting there, living for Tony performances singin' and flippin' along with the Pippins and Wickeds and Kinkys, Matildas and Mormonses\nSo we might reassure that kid and do something to spur that kid\n'Cause I promise you all of us up here tonight\nWe were that kid and now we're bigger\nTonight it's bigger\nSo let's create the biggest spectacle we know!\nCome see the super sexy Cinderella sisters celebrating\nLadies grab a fella, the tempo is accelerating\nSpidey, Pippin, Motown, Phantom, Kinky, Rock of Ages\nChicago, Bring it On, A Christmas Story sharing stages\nMamma Mia, Lion King, The Jersey Boys are tappin'\nKathie Lee's a Broadway lyricist, so anything can happen\n\nBigger!\nNew York is bigger!\nSo welcome to our bigger better bigger better\nBest of Broadway Tony Show!"

    "genre": "country",
    "lyrics": "On the 14th day of April of 1935\nThere struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky\nYou could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black\nAnd through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track\n\nFrom Oklahoma City to the Arizona line\nDakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande\nIt fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down\nWe thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom\n\nThe radio reported, we listened with alarm\nThe wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm\nFrom Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico\nThey said it was the blackest that ever they had saw\n\nFrom old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell\nAnd a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill\nFrom Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong\nThey thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long\n\nOur relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks\nAnd the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks\nAnd the family it was crowded into their little room\nThey thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom\nThe storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night\nWhen we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight\nWe saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown\nWas now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown\n\nIt covered up our fences, it covered up our barns\nIt covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm\nWe loaded our jalopies and piled our families in\nWe rattled down that highway to never come back again"

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe claim we hold is as good as gold, bonanza\nHand in hand we built this land, the Ponderosa Ranch\nOur birthright is this Cartwright bonanza\nWe here belong, and standing strong, wrong doesn't have a chance\n\n[Chorus]\nDay by day, work or play, ready side by side\nHello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide\nBound to be a fighting free bonanza\nSinging pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery tree and flower is part of our bonanza\nThe stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch\nWe ride along four men strong together\nEvery plain and ridge is our heritage, Ponderosa Ranch\n\n[Chorus]"
